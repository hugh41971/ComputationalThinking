# Computational Thinking Exercises

This is a starter project for the exercises listed in the Computational Thinking Exercise descriptions below.

- Clone this repository to your local machine
- Open the solution in Visual Studio
- Open the Program class
- A method has been added to the Program class for each exercise
- Go to the method for the exercise you'd like to add
- Add your code after the comment, 'Enter your solution here'

## Are These Integers Equal?

Write a console application to ask the user for two integers. Check and see if the two integers are equal to each other. If they are, inform the the user that the numbers are equal, else inform the user that the numbers are not equal

```
Input: 16
Input: 18
Output: The numbers 16 and 18 are not equal to each other
```

```
Input:Enter your first number: 25
Input: Enter your second number: 25
Output: The numbers 25 and 25 are the same number
```

## Even or Odd?

Write a console application that asks the user for a number. Tell the user if that number is even or odd.

```
Input: 15
Output: 15 is an odd number
```

```
Input: 116
Output: 116 is an even number
```

## Vowel or Consonant?

Write a console application to check whether a letter is a vowel or consonant. Hint: You can do this problem using a switch or an if condition.

```
Input: a
Output: That letter a is a vowel
```

```
Input: c
Output: The letter c is a consonant
```

## Find the Largest Number

Write a console application that prompts the user to input two integer values. Find and print the greatest value of the two integers.

```
Input:  25
Input: -25
Output: 25 is the larger number
```

- BONUS: Ask the user for 3 numbers and find the greatest value between those 3 numbers

## Divisible by 3

Ask the user for a number and then tell them if it is divisible by 3

```
Input: 5
Output: not divisible by 3
```

```
Input: 306
Output: divisible by 3
```

## Restaurant Bill

At a restaurant, Mike and his three friends decided to divide the bill evenly. If each person paid \$13 then what was the total bill?

- Returning to the above problem, replace hard-coded values of 4 (number of diners) and 13 (cost per diner) with values provided by the user.
- How nice! The restaurant is having Customer Appreciation Week. If a table’s total bill is \$50 or more, then they’ll receive a 10% discount! Otherwise, they’ll receive a 5% discount.

## Age Category

You're responsible for providing a demographic report for your local school district based on age. To do this, you're going to determine which 'category' each person fits into based on their age. The person's age will determine which category they should be in:

- If they're from 0 to 2 the child should be with parents print : 'Still in Mama's Arms'
- If they're 3 or 4 and should be in preschool print : 'Preschool Maniac'
- If they're from 5 to 11 and should be in elementary school print : 'Elementary School'
- From 12 to 14: 'Middle School'
- From 15 to 18: 'High School'
- From 19 to 22: 'College'
- From 23 to 65: 'Working for the Man'
- From 66 to 100: 'The Golden Years'
- If the age of the person is less than 0 or more than 100 - it might be an alien - print: "This program is for humans".

```
Input: 13
Output: You are in Middle School
```

## Words to Digits

Having a string representation of a number, you need to print the digit form of the number. Ask the user to enter a string representation of a number from zero to ten. Using switch case, print the digit (0-10) representation of the number.

```
Input: two
Output: 2
```

## Which Name is Longer?

Ask the user for their first and last name.

- Print the user's full name.
- If the first name is longer than the last name, print "First is longer."
- If the first name and last name are the same length, print "Same-sies!"
- Otherwise, print "Last must be longer!"

```
Input: Mary
Input: Brown
Output: Mary Brown. Last must be longer!
```

## Are these Names the Same?

Ask the user for 2 names.

- If the two names are the same, print "The names are the same."
- If they're not the same, print "The names are different."

```
Input: Joe
Input: Joseph
Output: The names are different
```

_First try using == and then try it using .Equals()_

## Name and Place of Birth

Ask the user for their first name and where they were born.  Print a sentence to the console that repeats this information.

```
Input: John
Input: Delaware
Output: Hi John!  You were born in Delaware.
```

```
Input: Yvonne
Input: San Diego
Output: Hi Yvonne!  You were born in San Diego.
```
